## Overview

A basic QR code page to practise HTML, CSS, VSCode & Github.

### Screenshots

I noticed, that it helped me to put borders on the different divs/sections of the page. Without them it was more difficult for me to recognize dome of the alignings and paddings. Of course I removed them before submitting (at least I hope I did...).

## My process

It had been a while since I made the basics of HTML & CSS. So this project was a good way to dig up the information from my head (and many, many websites).
I started by checking setting up my VSCode and Github.
Then I checked what kind of projects others have done, and I started from there.
Can't say many things about my code, but I feel like I should try to do this later on, when I have learnt more.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Google fonts
- googling, copy-pasting and modifying

### What I learned

I learned, that I need to study and practise more!
I should also remenber that using visual help (the borders) can help, especially when learning new things.
VSCode was also new for me, I have tried it only once before.

### Continued development

I will do a recap to my previous HTML & CSS courses. I still need more understanding on the basic stuff, and I need to practise and do more projects.
